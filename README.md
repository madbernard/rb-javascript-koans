From Remote Beta's version of Javascript Koans.  They say:

This repo contains a bunch of failing tests. Find them in /spec.

Basic requirements:

Make the following tests pass:
Expects
Arrays
Functions
Objects

Extra credit:

Make the rest of the tests pass.

You shouldn't need to write any Jasmine code, but if you'd like to know more, check out their docs.
